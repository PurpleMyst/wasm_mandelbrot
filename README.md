# wasm_mandelbrot

This is a weird experiment in emscripten, JavaScript, C and WebAssembly.
Just type `make run` into your terminal to open up a web-page which, after a
few seconds (~10s), will pop up with a weird fractal.

I leave the task of installing `make` and `emcc` to the reader, as it shouldn't
be too hard.
